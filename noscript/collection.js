[ ] should we drop cache for data portions that were just got?
    for example I surf some album and when I get to 15th page cache timeout is reached and we drop
    all data (including the 14th page)
[ ] when I request a photo A from the 0 page and then I request full 0 page should I check for photo A presense in cache?
